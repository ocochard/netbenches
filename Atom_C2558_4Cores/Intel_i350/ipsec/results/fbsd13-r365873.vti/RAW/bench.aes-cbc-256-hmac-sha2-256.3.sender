CMD on 192.168.1.1: equilibrium -4 -u -d 00:08:a2:09:33:da -t igb1 -r igb2
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 84 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 84 Mb/s
  - Step = 42 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 83 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 105 Mb/s
  - Step = 21 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 85 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 95 Mb/s
  - Step = 10 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 85 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 90 Mb/s
  - Step = 5 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 85 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 88 Mb/s
  - Step = 2 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 85 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 87 Mb/s
  - Step = 1 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 85 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 85 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 85 Mb/s)
