Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 135 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 135 Mb/s
  - Step = 67 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 135 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 168 Mb/s
  - Step = 33 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 139 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 152 Mb/s
  - Step = 16 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 142 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 144 Mb/s
  - Step = 8 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 142 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 148 Mb/s
  - Step = 4 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 140 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 146 Mb/s
  - Step = 2 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 142 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 142 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 142 Mb/s)
