Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 406 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 406 Mb/s
  - Step = 203 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 404 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 507 Mb/s
  - Step = 101 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 406 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 457 Mb/s
  - Step = 50 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 405 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 432 Mb/s
  - Step = 25 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 405 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 420 Mb/s
  - Step = 12 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 405 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 414 Mb/s
  - Step = 6 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 404 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 404 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 406 Mb/s)
