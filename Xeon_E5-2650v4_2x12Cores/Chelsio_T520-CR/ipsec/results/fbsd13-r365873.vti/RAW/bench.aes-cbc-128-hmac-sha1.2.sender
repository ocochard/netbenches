Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 470 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 470 Mb/s
  - Step = 235 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 463 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 235 Mb/s
  - Step = 235 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 235 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 352 Mb/s
  - Step = 117 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 352 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 410 Mb/s
  - Step = 58 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 410 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 439 Mb/s
  - Step = 29 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 439 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 453 Mb/s
  - Step = 14 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 453 Mb/s
Iteration 8
  - Offering load = 460 Mb/s
  - Step = 7 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 460 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 460 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 470 Mb/s)
