Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 248 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 248 Mb/s
  - Step = 124 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 248 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 310 Mb/s
  - Step = 62 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 258 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 279 Mb/s
  - Step = 31 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 259 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 264 Mb/s
  - Step = 15 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 260 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 257 Mb/s
  - Step = 7 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 257 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 260 Mb/s
  - Step = 3 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 260 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 260 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 260 Mb/s)
