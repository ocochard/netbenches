Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 210 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 210 Mb/s
  - Step = 105 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 210 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 262 Mb/s
  - Step = 52 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 220 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 236 Mb/s
  - Step = 26 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 221 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 223 Mb/s
  - Step = 13 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 221 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 229 Mb/s
  - Step = 6 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 221 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 226 Mb/s
  - Step = 3 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 220 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 220 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 221 Mb/s)
