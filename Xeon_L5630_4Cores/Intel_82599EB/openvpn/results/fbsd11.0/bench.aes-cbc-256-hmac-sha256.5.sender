Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 214 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 214 Mb/s
  - Step = 107 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 214 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 267 Mb/s
  - Step = 53 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 223 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 241 Mb/s
  - Step = 26 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 224 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 228 Mb/s
  - Step = 13 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 224 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 222 Mb/s
  - Step = 6 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 222 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 225 Mb/s
  - Step = 3 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 224 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 224 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 224 Mb/s)
