Enabling 802.1q notes

Need to add VLAN 802.1q to DUT ports, replacing vlan on pkt-receiver, updating static MAC table:

set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:78
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:7a
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:78
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:7a

If using SM1 (cxl1) as pkt-gen receiver:
set interfaces xe-0/0/7 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete interfaces xe-0/0/7 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members bench
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:98
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:9a
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:98
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:9a

if using r630 (cxl1) as pkt-gen receiver:
set interfaces xe-0/0/14 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete interfaces xe-0/0/14 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members bench
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:b8
delete vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:ba
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:b8
set vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:ba

Reverting changes:

delete interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
delete interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
delete interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:78
delete vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:7a
set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:78
set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/1.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e4:7a

If using SM1 (cxl1) as pkt-gen receiver:
set interfaces xe-0/0/7 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members bench
delete interfaces xe-0/0/7 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:98

set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:98
set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/7.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2e:e5:9a

if using r630 (cxl1) as pkt-gen receiver:
set interfaces xe-0/0/7 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members bench
delete interfaces xe-0/0/14 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members benchvlan
delete vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:b8
delete vlans benchvlan switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:ba
set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:b8
set vlans bench switch-options interface xe-0/0/14.0 static-mac 00:07:43:2f:fe:ba
