CMD on 192.168.1.2: equilibrium -4 -d 00:07:43:2e:e5:90 -t vcxl0 -r vcxl1 -l 10000
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 484 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 484 Mb/s
  - Step = 242 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 483 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 605 Mb/s
  - Step = 121 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 604 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 665 Mb/s
  - Step = 60 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 664 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 695 Mb/s
  - Step = 30 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 694 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 710 Mb/s
  - Step = 15 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 709 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 709 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 709 Mb/s)
