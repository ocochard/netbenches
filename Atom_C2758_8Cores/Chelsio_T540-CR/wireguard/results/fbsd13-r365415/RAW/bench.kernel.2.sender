CMD on 192.168.1.2: equilibrium -4 -d 00:07:43:2e:e5:90 -t vcxl0 -r vcxl1 -l 10000
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 490 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 490 Mb/s
  - Step = 245 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 490 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 612 Mb/s
  - Step = 122 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 612 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 673 Mb/s
  - Step = 61 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 673 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 703 Mb/s
  - Step = 30 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 702 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 718 Mb/s
  - Step = 15 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 717 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 717 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 717 Mb/s)
