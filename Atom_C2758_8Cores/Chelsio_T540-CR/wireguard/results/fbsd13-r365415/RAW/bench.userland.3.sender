CMD on 192.168.1.2: equilibrium -4 -d 00:07:43:2e:e5:90 -t vcxl0 -r vcxl1 -l 10000
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 171 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 171 Mb/s
  - Step = 85 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 83 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 86 Mb/s
  - Step = 85 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 78 Mb/s
  - Too big initial value, need to reduce STEP
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 43 Mb/s
  - Step = 42 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 42 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 64 Mb/s
  - Step = 21 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 63 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 74 Mb/s
  - Step = 10 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 73 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 79 Mb/s
  - Step = 5 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 76 Mb/s
Iteration 8
  - Offering load = 77 Mb/s
  - Step = 2 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 74 Mb/s
Iteration 9
  - Offering load = 76 Mb/s
  - Step = 1 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 74 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 74 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 171 Mb/s)
