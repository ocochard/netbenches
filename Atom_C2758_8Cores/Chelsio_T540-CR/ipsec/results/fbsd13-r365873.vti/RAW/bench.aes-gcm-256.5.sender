CMD on 192.168.1.2: equilibrium -4 -d 00:07:43:2e:e5:90 -t vcxl0 -r vcxl1 -l 10000
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1558 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 1558 Mb/s
  - Step = 779 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1557 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 1947 Mb/s
  - Step = 389 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1562 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 1753 Mb/s
  - Step = 194 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1559 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 1656 Mb/s
  - Step = 97 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1560 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 1608 Mb/s
  - Step = 48 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1560 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 1584 Mb/s
  - Step = 24 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1558 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 1558 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 1562 Mb/s)
