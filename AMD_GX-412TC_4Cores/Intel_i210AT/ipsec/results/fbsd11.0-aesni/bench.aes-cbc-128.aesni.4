Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Mode: IPSec gateway benchmark
- UDP load = 500B, IP packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- TOLERANCE = 0.01
- Software netmap UDP checksum = on
Iteration 1
  - offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - STEP = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 386 Mb/s
Iteration 2
  - offering load = 250 Mb/s
  - STEP = 250 Mb/s
  - TREND = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 250 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - offering load = 375 Mb/s
  - STEP = 125 Mb/s
  - TREND = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 375 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - offering load = 437 Mb/s
  - STEP = 62 Mb/s
  - TREND = increasing
