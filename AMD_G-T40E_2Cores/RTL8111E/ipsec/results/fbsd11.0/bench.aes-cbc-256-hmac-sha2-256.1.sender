Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 100 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 50 Mb/s
  - Step = 25 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 50 Mb/s
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 75 Mb/s
  - Step = 25 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 61 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 63 Mb/s
  - Step = 12 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 61 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 57 Mb/s
  - Step = 6 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 56 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 60 Mb/s
  - Step = 3 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 60 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 61 Mb/s
  - Step = 1 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 60 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 60 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 61 Mb/s)
